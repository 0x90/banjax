Banjax is a library for low-level programming of IEEE 802.11 wireless
network interfaces on the GNU/Linux operating system. The library is
intended to simplify the writing of programs that sniff, manipulate
and inject IEEE 802.11 traffic. Uses for banjax include traffic
analysis, monitoring of link quality and capacity and performing acts
of network evil such as deauthentication and man-in-the-middle
attacks. Banjax is written in C++ and there is a SWIG wrapper to
access banjax functionality from Guile.
