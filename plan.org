* ELC Paper

** Metric implementation
*** DONE ELC
**** DONE Verify contention model
**** DONE IP layer throughput measurement (for comparison of saturated link)
*** DONE ELC_MRR
**** TODO Implement RTS retries in MRR metric
*** TODO elc_nl80211
*** DONE "Old" or legacy ELC
**** TODO Fixing rate buckets (currently not mapping avg rate to closest 802.11 rate)
**** TODO Using TMT instead of measured rate
**** TODO Comparison of above
*** DONE utilization_metric
Simple measurement of the goodput
If a frame is IP then we add the payload to a count for this period
Needs improvement to check frame headers
*** TODO ETX
**** DONE Probe
***** DONE Switch to use of absolute clock
***** TODO Introduce pseudo-random jitter
***** DONE Use probes to compute forward delivery ratio
***** TODO Measure losses due to collisions
**** TODO Banjax offline metric calcultion from probe packets
*** DONE abstract_metric
Used to share common methods amongst metrics
*** TODO ETT
*** TODO RELC
*** DONE metric_group
*** DONE metric_demux

** Banjax update
*** DONE Add ACKTIMEOUT to encoding
*** TODO Fix for packet injection
*** TODO Merge changes into banjax

** Draft paper
*** Skeleton
Old ELC
Comparison with new ELC, ETX
Discussion of mechanism cost: NL80211 vs monitor-mode interfaces
*** Experimental Design
**** ELC 
Two nodes, variable attentuator, separate monitor.
Conduct iperf for 5 minutes varying: link quality, saturation level
**** RELC
Two nodes, variable attentuator, "hidden" terminal, separate monitor.
Conduct iperf between all three stations for 5 minutes varying: link
quality, saturation level on measured link, saturation level on
"hidden" terminal link.
